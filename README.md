## Description 

> A *cis*-eQTL meta-analysis, called "***SingleBrain***", integrates publicly available snRNA-seq and genotype data from four independent cohorts: *Fujita* et al., *Mathys* et al., *Gabitto* et al., and *Bryois* et al.

> a) Integration of publicly available single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and genotype data from four independent studies. A *cis*-eQTL meta-analysis was conducted across major central nervous system (CNS) cells and subtypes using a linear mixed model approach (multivariate multiple QTL, mmQTL). b) Cell proportion of each donor. c) Candidate genes and putative causal variants associated with neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases were identified through statistical colocalization, Mendelian randomization, and fine-mapping.
